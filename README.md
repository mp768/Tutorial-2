Tutorial 2 done with Godot

Controls:
- Left Mouse Button for Player 1
    * Or W
- Right Mouse Button for Player 2
    * Or Up Arrow

Original Unity-based instructions:
- One Windows executable  (.exe, with _Data folder, UnityPlayer.dll, and Mono or MonoBleedingEdge folder next to it) of your completed tutorial project.
- One Mac executable (.app) of your completed tutorial project. If you are having trouble running it, try these suggested fixes.
- One Assets folder (the top-level folder titled "Assets" in your Unity project).
- One ProjectSettings folder (the top-level folder titled "ProjectSettings" in your Unity project).
- One Packages folder (the top-level folder titled “Packages” in your Unity project).

Godot equivalents:
- `Build/Windows` contains the Windows executable along with a `.pck` file (which contains the game's assets).
- `Build/Mac` contains the Mac app.
- `Assets` contains all scene and script data (although it's actually not needed in Godot, as everything in the project folder is considered "Assets", we just organized it this way for familarity sake).
- `project.godot` is the equivalent to `ProjectSettings` folder in Unity.
- an `addons` folder would be the cloest equivalent to Unity's `Packages` folder. However, since we didn't use any plugins or addons, it doesn't exist here.
